# ðŸ§  Takeo.AI Bootcamp Practice Repository

This repository contains all my practice work and learning exercises from the **Takeo.AI Data Analytics & AI Bootcamp**.

It includes hands-on sessions, daily exercises, mini-projects, and notes as I progress through topics like Python, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning.

The purpose of this repo is to track my learning, organize code, and reflect my growth throughout the program.
